### Project goals
High Cuisine is the 3rd milestone project for Code Institute Data Centric Development module. The goal of this project is to create, store, edit and delete recipes (CRUD). The target group of this project consists of people who like to cook with cannabis.
The focus is on people with chronic diseases. My personal goal was to create a very simple recipe site on which the user can upload recipes quickly and easily and does not receive too much other distracting information.
A secondary goal is to sell a print version of a fictitious cookbook and the Levo Infuser.
