<h2 class="green-text">The Basics</h2>
<h4 class="green-text">Introduction</h4>
<p>Cooking with cannabis can be a culinary enrichment and a pleasant form of consumption.
    It takes a little bit of basic knowledge and some preparation to get started.
    In order for cannabis to become an ingredient to cook with, it must be extracted.
    Since the effect only sets in after about 30 to 60 minutes with culinary use, please be patient and do not overeat.

<h4 class="green-text" id="boxy">Decarboxylation</h4>
<p>
Using cannabis as a medicine begins with understanding the basic science of decarboxylation,
and why it is a crucial process in making edibles, tinctures and topical treatments.
To get the full medicinal value out of your cannabis, it needs to be heated to a temperature 
that is just not possible to obtain in the human digestive system. The major downside of decarboxylating
 is that some of the more volatile terpenes (and other aromatics) that give the plant its signature aroma
  and flavor are lost during the process. Adding an equal amount of raw material to the decarboxylated materials
   may improve the taste and/or smell of your creations, but learning how to properly decarboxylate cannabis
    from the get-go will save you a lot of time, energy, money and product when cooking with cannabis.
</p>
<h5 class="green-text">The Process</h5>
<p><strong>Forewarning: There will be a very strong odor of cannabis during this process.</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 225° F / 110° C.</li>
    <li>Line an oven-safe dish (or a rimmed baking sheet) with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Breaking up cannabis buds into smaller pieces by hand, place the material in the dish close together but not stacked on one another (the less unused space the better).</li>
    <li>When oven is pre-heated, bake for about 20 minutes to remove the moisture (depending on the freshness of the material). Watch for the plant color to get darker (a light to medium brown shade). When it is time to remove from the oven, the material should be crumbly looking.</li>
    <li>Set plant material aside and wait until it is cool enough to handle. Turn oven up to 240° F / 115° C and wait for it to preheat again.</li>
    <li>When the cannabis is cooled, lightly crumble by hand and distribute evenly over the bottom of the dish.</li>
    <li>Cover dish with aluminum foil, crimping the edges tight to seal and return to the oven. Continue baking for another 45-60 minutes for higher THC and 60-90 minutes for higher CBD.</li>
    <li>Remove from oven and allow to cool fully before removing the foil. Depending on the material you use, it may be fine enough and require no further processing. If not, you can place the material in a food processor or blender, pulsing the cannabis until it is coarsely ground. Be careful not to over grind the material, as you do not want a super fine powder.</li>
    <li>Place in an airtight container (glass preferred) and store in a cool, dry place.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="green-text">Cannabutter</h4>
<p>When you’re making marijuana-infused butter (cannabutter), the key thing to remember is “low and slow” (eg, low temperature, slow cook time). Infusing the butter over low heat for several hours allows for full activation of the THC without scorching the herb or wasting material.
THC and CBD are not soluble in water, but are in certain carrier oils. Therefore, the butter fats act as carriers and “soak up” the cannabinoids, terpenes and flavonoids, leaving any impurities in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>If you are looking for a more psychoactive effect (eg. the high commonly associated with THC), then it is recommended that you completely decarboxylate your cannabis before cooking with it. The ‘decarbing’ process ensures the cannabinoids are activated and no longer in their acid-form (THCa, CBDa, etc.).</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Ingredients & Tools</h5>
<ul class="basics">
    <li>1 pound butter (unsalted preferred)</li>
    <li>1 quart (4 cups) of water</li>
    <li>Metal spoon</li>
    <li>Spatula</li>
    <li>Medium saucepan / pot (2 or 3 quart)</li>
    <li>Glass or stainless steel bowl (2 quart)</li>
    <li>Metal strainer or colander</li>
    <li>2 pieces of cheesecloth (approx 8” x 8”)</li>
    <li>Food handling gloves</li>
    <li>Knife</li>
    <li>Plastic wrap or airtight container(s)</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Combine water, butter (cut into several pieces) and cannabis into pan and cook over low heat – the mixture should never boil but simply simmer. Continue cooking for 3-4 hours.</li>
    <li>Every 30 minutes or so stir gently. The mixture will thicken as the water cooks off. Don’t allow mixture to become too thick. The cannabis should float about 2 inches from the bottom of the pan and should never touch the bottom. If necessary, add water.</li>
    <li>After 3-4 hours, when the mixture looks glossy and is more dense and compact (most of the water has evaporated), turn off heat and allow to cool.</li>
    <li>While the butter mixture is cooling, line a metal colander or strainer with a double layer of cheesecloth (be sure to allow a few inches of overhang).</li>
    <li>When mixture is safe to handle, pour the butter and cannabis mixture into the colander/strainer, pressing down with back of spatula, allowing the butter to drain into the glass bowl.</li>
    <li>With gloved hands, bring together the corners of the cheesecloth and twist tightly to squeeze out all of the butter. Discard cannabis.</li>
    <li>Using the spatula, scrape out any residual butter left in pan into the bowl.</li>
    <li>Place bowl in fridge for about 2 hours, or until butter has solidified.</li>
    <li>After the butter has solidified, the next step is to remove it from the water. Run a knife around edges to separate the butter from the bowl, and then cut a small piece from edge (but large enough to feed spatula underneath).</li>
    <li>Carefully lift the butter layer and place wet side up on wax paper or cutting board and dab off any excess water with dry clean cloth. Your finished butter will have a green tinge.</li>
    <li>Place the cannabutter into an airtight container, and store in fridge until ready to use.</li>
    <li>It is recommended cannabutter be used immediately, or within a few weeks for optimal quality.</li>
</ol>
<h5 class="green-text">Cannabis Infused Butter Storage Tips</h5>
<p>As long as you use an airtight container or storage bag (plastic wrap works, too, if sealed tightly), your cannabutter will keep in the fridge for several weeks or in the freezer for up to six months. It is a good idea to separate into individual doses or measurements first, especially if freezing.</p>

<h4 class="green-text">Cannabis Infused Cooking Oil</h4>
<p>Cannabis infused cooking oils, commonly referred to as canna oils, are popular among many medical marijuana patients and caregivers looking to infuse everything from salad dressings to dipping sauces to baked goods. Most oils are vegan-friendly and extremely easy to add into recipes with savory meals like steak or chicken. Additionally, infused cooking oils may serve as a healthy substitute for butter in many recipes. These factors make marijuana-infused cooking oils a must-have for most medical marijuana patients when it comes to cooking with cannabis at home.</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Ingredients</h5>
<ul class="basics">
    <li>6 cups extra virgin olive oil (organic preferred) (or)canola oil (backup oil — not preferred)</li>
    <li>~1 ounce cannabis buds, finely ground (or) ~2 ounces of leaf trim, dried and finely ground</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>In a heavy saucepan (or a double boiler), slowly heat the cooking oil on low heat for a few minutes. You should begin to smell the aroma coming from the oil.</li>
    <li>Add a little bit of cannabis to the oil and then stir until it is fully coated with oil. Keep adding more cannabis until the entire amount of cannabis is mixed into the oil.</li>
    <li>Simmer on low heat for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to cool before straining.</li>
    <li>Press the cannabis against a metal strainer with the back of a spoon to wring all the oil out of it.</li>
    <li>The oil is best stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 months.</li>
    <li>Throw the leftover cannabis in the compost.</li>
</ol>
<h4 class="green-text">Infused Coconut Oil</h4>
<p>Making cannabis-infused coconut oil is as simple as steeping quality herb in a quality oil. Machines are available to make cannabis-infused coconut oil, but the infusion process can be done right on a stovetop or hot plate with the help of a double boiler.</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Ingredients & Tools</h5>
<ul class="basics">
    <li>Double boiler (you can make one if you don’t own one)</li>
    <li>¼ to ½ ounce of cannabis</li>
    <li>1 cup of coconut oil (organic, expeller-pressed works best for this process)</li>
    <li>2-3 feet of cooking twine (a clean unused white shoestring will work in a pinch)</li>
    <li>Cheesecloth (about an 8” x 10” piece)</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>
        <ul>
            <li>Lay the cheese cloth out flat</li>
            <li>Place the cannabis (breaking up larger pieces) into the middle and distribute evenly over a small area (remember the packet needs to fit into the top pan)</li>
            <li>Fold in opposite ends to cover the herb</li>
            <li>Now fold in one of the open ends, tuck and roll</li>
            <li>Tie the roll of herb tightly with cooking twine (tying a knot in one end and then guiding the twine through it works good)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fill the bottom pan of a double boiler with a few inches of water (allowing enough space so that it does not touch the top pan) and set the shallow pan on top. Place over medium heat to a gentle boil – NOT a rolling boil.</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of coconut oil to the top pan.</li>
    <li>When the coconut oil is almost melted, add about 1 cup of water so that the liquid will cover the herb packet
        (Note: Coconut oil is nonpolar and water is polar so they will naturally separate when chilled; and THC and CBD are not soluble in water, but are in certain carrier oils. Therefore, the coconut oil acts as the carrier and will “soak” up the cannabinoids, leaving any impurities in the water.)</li>
    <li>Continue heating the oil and water mixture until all of the coconut oil is melted and then add the herb packet – pressing down gently into the liquid using a metal spoon.</li>
    <li>Cover and leave to cook for 90 minutes, checking back every half hour or so to flip over the packet and stir it around gently. Also, check the water in the bottom pan to make sure it is not boiling too hard and that the water level is still good – be careful to avoid any escaping steam when removing the top pan.</li>
    <li>After 90 minutes, the oil and water mixture should be a deep green color. At this point, turn off the heat and remove the herb packet and place in a bowl. Squeeze out any oil that is trapped in the “herb packet” by pressing with a spoon (when it cools down, you can give it another squeeze by hand to get every drop). Add this to the liquid mixture and place in the refrigerator to cool.</li>
    <li>When the mixture is cooled, the water and oil separate (dirty looking water on the bottom and a nice green color solidified oil containing the good stuff on top). Gently poke 2 or 3 holes through the oil, turn over (holding your hand gently over the oil) and drain the water off.</li>
    <li>If you are not going to use the oil immediately, store in a container (glass preferred) and label with date, strain and ratio. This will help you determine which strains and in what quantities work best for you.</li>   
</ol>
<p>The most important thing to remember is that the effects of consuming cannabis-infused coconut oil (directly or as an ingredient in a cooked dish) are usually slow-acting due to the cannabinoids having to be digested first. As such, it may take up to three (3) hours for you to feel its maximum effects, and those effects could last for awhile. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or concerned about overdosing, don’t panic — no one has ever died as a direct result of consuming cannabis.</p>
<h4 class="green-text">Infused Honey</h4>
<p>Honey, hi! The possibilities are endless for this versatile cannabis infusion. Use it in lieu of other types of sweetener by incorporating it into your favourite sweet and savoury dishes (think: honey oat muffins, chocolate avocado mousse, smoothies, and more), or just simply stir the sweet liquid gold into a cup of tea or drizzle over a cheeseboard.</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup of honey</li>
    <li>3.5 grams of  cannabis <a href="#boxy">(decarboxylated)</a></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Decarb the cannabis. Preheat your oven to 245ºF. Place cannabis buds on a non-stick, oven-safe tray. Cover the tray with parchment paper to prevent sticking. Insert the tray into the oven and set a timer for 30-40 minutes. Older, drier cannabis may require less time. (Tip: you can also set your oven to 300ºF and heat for 10 to 18 minutes, although low-and-slow is the recommended approach when decarbing to better preserve the cannabinoids.) 
        Every 10 minutes, gently mix the buds with a light shake of the tray to expose the surface area of the buds equally.</li>
    <li>Combine the cannabis and honey in a double boiler to apply gentle heat on the stove top.</li>
    <li>Simmer. Maintain low heat and let the mixture simmer for at least 40 minutes. The mixture should never come to a full boil.</li>
    <li>Strain the honey. Set a funnel on top of a jar and line it with cheesecloth. Once the honey has cooled off, pour it over the cheesecloth funnel and allow it to strain freely. (Tip: Squeezing the cheesecloth may push more bad-tasting plant material through).</li>
    <li>Storing: Honey can be stored in a cool dark area for 1-2 months.</li>
    <li>Dose carefully. Refer to dosing information below before adding your honey to any snacks, dishes, or desserts.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="green-text">Cannabis Tincture</h4>
<p>Cannabis tinctures are alcohol-based cannabis extracts—essentially, cannabis-infused alcohol. In fact, tinctures were the main form of cannabis medicine until the United States enacted cannabis prohibition. They’re a great entry point for both recreational and medical consumers looking to ease into smokeless consumption methods.</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Choosing the right type of alcohol for tinctures</h5>
<p>The goal is to find a high-proof alcohol that is safe for consumption. The higher the alcohol content, the better it will dissolve cannabis resin. Everclear is my alcohol of choice when making a tincture, as it is both safe to consume and highly potent.
Products like isopropyl alcohol are not intended to be consumed and should never be used when making a tincture—save that for cleaning your pipes!</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li><a href="#boxy">Decarboxylate </a>your cannabis flower or concentrate (if you’re using flower, grind it to a fine consistency).</li>
    <li>Mix your flower or concentrate in a mason jar with high-proof alcohol (preferably Everclear).</li>
    <li>Close the jar and let it sit for a few weeks, shaking it once a day.</li>
    <li>After a few weeks, strain it through a coffee filter.</li>
</ol>
<p>And if you don’t feel like waiting several weeks, you can even get away with shaking it for 3 minutes, straining, and storing.</p>

<!-- Text from https://potguide.com/blog/article/how-to-make-cannabis-infused-milk/ -->
<h4 class="green-text">Cannabis-Infused Milk</h4>
<p>Though often overlooked, milks make a great medium for cannabis infusions. Not only are they tasty but they’re also filled with those glorious lipids (fats) that cannabinoids love so much. In fact, cannabinoids won’t stick to anything but fats or alcohol, and since alcohol products aren’t ideal for all consumers, having another source of liquid infusion is pretty important.</p>
<p>Because cannabinoids require lipids to bind to, the best milk or milk-substitute products (nut milks, oat milks, soy milks, etc.) to use for cannabis infusions will be the fully-fatty kind (no skim or reduced fat) like whole milk, coconut milk or heavy cream. That being said, most milks do contain some fat content so
     feel free to use whichever option you like best – regular milks or plant-based options will both work!</p>
<h5 class="green-text">Ingredients</h5>
<ul class="basics">
    <li>Milk, Cream, Coconut Milk or Other Milk Substitute</li>
    <li>1 Gram of <a href="#boxy">Decarboxylated</a> Cannabis Per Liter of Milk</li>
    <li>Sauce Pan</li>
    <li>Whisk</li>
    <li>Cheesecloth</li>
    <li>Air-tight Liquid Storage Container (i.e. Mason Jar)</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="green-text">Directions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Finely grind your cannabis into a powder (the finer the grind, the better it will infuse into your milk)</li>
    <li>Next, add your finely ground cannabis directly to your milk, place over low heat and whisk to combine. Be careful not to let the mixture boil over!</li>
    <li>Stir the milk mixture frequently to prevent scorching and allow the cannabis and milk to simmer for 30 minutes to an hour depending on your preferred potency</li>
    <li>After 30 minutes to an hour, remove from heat and let sit for 5-10 minutes to help the cannabinoids set into the fat cells</li>
    <li>Place cheesecloth over the top of a large mason jar or other air-tight liquid storage container then pour the mixture over the cheesecloth to strain out all plant matter</li>
    <li>When it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze all excess liquid from the cheesecloth into your storage container</li>
    <li>Tightly seal your container, label with its contents and expiration date (the same date that was listed on the milk container) or freeze in ice cube trays for later use</li>
    <li>Always remember to label all cannabis-infused products (including your canna-milk ice cubes) and keep them secured away from children at all times</li>
</ol>
